// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Ask the user for an integer input and store it in a variable called "number."
2. Check if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (%).
3. If the result of the modulo operator is 0, print "The number is even."
4. If the result of the modulo operator is 1, print "The number is odd."

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

(n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5= avg

small = n1

large = n1

for i = 2 to 5:

   if n1 > ni then:

       small = ni

   if n1 < ni: then:

       large = ni

print("Average:", avg)

print("Smallest:", small)

print("Largest:", large)
